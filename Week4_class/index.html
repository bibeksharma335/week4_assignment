                        <p>The Pashupatinath Temple, located on the banks of the Bagmati River in Kathmandu, Nepal, is one of the holiest Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and holds significant religious, cultural, and historical importance. Pashupatinath is one of the most important religious sites in Asia for devotees of Shiva. It is believed that Lord Shiva, in his Pashupati form, resides here.

The temple's sanctum houses a unique four-faced (Chaturmukha) lingam, which represents Shivaâ€™s omnipresence.

                    <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                    <p>Hinduism is one of the world's oldest religions, originating in the Indian subcontinent over 4,000 years ago. It is a complex, diverse faith with no single founder or central religious authority. Hinduism encompasses a wide array of beliefs, practices, and rituals. Central to the religion is the concept of Dharma (duty/ethical living), Karma (action and subsequent reaction), and Samsara (the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth).</p>
